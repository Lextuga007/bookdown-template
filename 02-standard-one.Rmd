### Reflective Practice

I was asked to find the smoking prevalence for mental health patients in the care of the Trust. Although smoking status had been recorded in two forms over the years the prevalence had never been calculated, only current smokers counted for [CQUINs](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-preventing-ill-health-from-alcohol-and-tobacco/health-matters-preventing-ill-health-from-alcohol-and-tobacco-use). Also, as the smoking status was not recorded regularly, to work out the yearly prevalence would require assuming smoking status for the years when they had an open referral but no smoking status recorded. I originally only had SQL and Excel as tools to complete this so I used SQL to combine data which counted:

1.  an assessment in a referral/inpatient stay
2.  an assessment before a referral/inpatient stay and assumed no change in smoking status in the interim period
3.  an assessment after a referral/inpatient stay and assumed no change

SQL was the only way I could script this logic to make it reproducible but when I was asked to update this I moved to R as this is a more flexible analytical and statistical language. By moving the code to another language I validated my previous logic and I realised it was better to produce a row for each year between assessments and fill down the missing years. I also had mistakenly counted the ages based on the admission dates and, of course, everyone ages each year so I changed the age calculation to be on the first of every year. This isn't quite accurate but is much closer than my initial approach.

I used RMarkdown to produce the workflow to bring the data together, including the [ONS smoking prevalence data](https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=%2fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2fhealthandsocialcare%2fdrugusealcoholandsmoking%2fdatasets%2fadultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain%2f2019/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain2019final.xls) from their website, manipulate this to create a new dataset and the produce statistics from it. This meant I could write more narrative around the analysis which, when it was in SQL, was comments in the script and could not shared.

The downside to using R was only that it takes longer than in SQL due to RAM needs and the function `dplyr::fill()` used to copy down information where it is missing took a long time; the dataset is a couple of million rows. I could get around this computational slowness by using a package called {data.table} which, whilst I'm not familiar with, is much faster at processing data than my usual package of choice, {dplyr}. I used very little of the {data.table} code to ensure that I did not introduce any errors/bugs that I could not understand.

### Reflective Practice

For mortality surveillance I used SPC (statistical process control) charts but for much of the analysis of mortality, SPC is not appropriate because of patterns like seasonality or very small numbers (as in the case of suspected/confirmed suicides).

For small number analysis I specifically chose to use time between charts in SPC, instead of count (xmr) or proportional charts for analysis as I wanted to see if there had been any decrease in the time between deaths as a pattern that should be monitored. The difficulty with these charts is conveying across to a audience who are familiar with SPCs that a point above the control limits is positive (in this context) as it relates to an increase in length of time between events. In order to check my reasoning on using these charts in this context I have presented my work at various analyst events.

#### Mortality

I presented this particular presentation at:

-   East Midlands [AphA (Association of Professional Healthcare Analysts)](https://www.aphanalysts.org/) branch meeting 1st November 2019

-   R-Ladies London 30th July 2019

-   NHS-R Community Conference 4-5th November 2019 lightning talk [NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/)

I used this presentation to show how I had used R to create a mortality surveillance report. It is related to the [Mortality surveillance slides](https://lextuga007.github.io/Presentations/mortality/MortalitySQL.html) in that this was the analysis part of the surveillance.

I did not study statistics formally but worked with colleagues to learn and apply statistical techniques in my work.
